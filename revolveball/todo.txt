	* "Lite" version with 5 demo levels
	* Updated level select
	* "How to play" graphic on first run
	* Additional "info" scene with rate/more games/reset data buttons
	* Rework "ending"
	* Add "Choose world" text to hub level

Remove
	* "Appirator" rating crap

Change
	* Start playing music on start of level, then pause, then unpause to see if that fixes lag
	* Add "ready" "go" beeps
	* Add "choose level" text to hub stage

	* Genius idea - Crib level select from Nonogram Madness, display each completed level as a slowly rotating TMX
