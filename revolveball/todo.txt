TO DO
-----
* Add "data reset" option to Info scene
* Create "choose world" text to add to hub level
* Determine new level select layout
* Add "ready" "go" beeps
* Start playing music on start of level, then pause, then unpause to see if that fixes lag
* Genius idea - Crib level select from Nonogram Madness, display each completed level as a slowly rotating TMX
